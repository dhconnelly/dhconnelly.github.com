My last day at Google was April 16th. Just short of ten years since my first internship, and just over eight years full-time. Mostly I've been very bored (see other posts), and the last year of pandemic and six months of leave really made me feel totally alienated from the company, my team, and my work. In all I had ten managers on eight teams in four product areas and was promoted twice, working across the entire stack, so it's hard to feel like I could have missed something. I don't know that it was really avoidable in the end.

Anyway, on Monday I start working at [Butterfly Network](https://www.butterflynetwork.com). They make portable, inexpensive ultrasound machines, and I'll be doing backend stuff to help them integrate with existing hospital systems. Very much looking forward to doing something so concrete with obvious value, and in a much smaller company. Also joining a couple of former colleagues, which is nice!
