Nina surprised me last weekend with a trip to Nürnberg for my birthday.  I've
been wanting to go for several months, so it was a nice surprise.  Although
most Americans are only familiar with the Nazi history -- first the rallies,
then the war trials -- Nürnberg was once one of the most important cities in
Europe, both as a center of trade and as one of the principal seats of the
Holy Roman Empire.  It was well-maintained and well-fortified, and although it
was bombed flat a few decades ago, enough of the structure and memories
remained that a visit today will reward the traveler with a faithfully
renovated and fascinating medieval town.

As an American tourist, one of the most striking things about German cities is
that German medieval architecture doesn't match our fairytale imaginings.
This is especially true of the churches, which are more plain than, and rarely
approach the violence of, Gothic cathedrals.  After all, the dominant style in
medieval Germany was not the Gothic, but the Romanesque, having been
well-established by the kingdoms of the early Middle Ages.  Besides, they had
more brick than stone.  The result is a different color and shape: redder and
rounder than the English and French gray and blocky.  

Nürnberg is a great example of this style.  Particularly interesting are the
town wall, which is punctuated by guard towers, as well as the brick churches
and the Imperial Castle on the hill.

Two things that are not to be missed:

1.  **Nürnberger Bratwurst**.  These are famous, at least in the sense that
everyone with whom I've discussed Nürnberg has mentioned them.  In fact, that's
the only thing they've mentioned, and so I'm not entirely sure how firm a grasp
other Europeans have of German history.  Anyway, these sausages will
immediately remind Americans of our ubiquitous breakfast sausages.  They're
considered "spicy"; that is, they have the audacity to contain spices other
than salt.

2.  **Kaiserburg, the Imperial Castle**.  This was one of the favorite castles
    of the Holy Roman Emperor, at least while that was still an elected title 
    and not a Habsburg family heirloom.  Somehow I managed to avoid taking a 
    decent photo of the castle by itself, but I did get a good one looking up 
    out of the dry moat.

    The castle sits on a hill overlooking the city, and consists of walls, a
    palace, several other castle-type buildings, a tower, and a courtyard, all
    beautifully restored since the war.  The palace contains a very nice museum
    filled with historical trinkets and explanatory placards.  The stable just
    outside the castle walls now houses a youth hostel; you, too, can travel
    around Germany, sleeping in castles, pretending to be the Holy Roman
    Emperor during his perpetual wanderings and pretendings at having a 
    coherent government.

Our trip happily coincided with a "mittelalter" festival being held in the
castle's dry moat.  This is, as far as I can tell, identical to the American
"Renaissance Festival," but with a more appropriate name and the good fortune
of being held in a genuine medieval town and not in a dusty field in the
suburbs of Georgia.  I love anachronism, and of course the castle is the
natural place to hold such a festival if you happen to live near one, but the
idea of fake knights walking around and jousting in a real moat is somehow more
amusing than doing it in rural America.  Anyway, there were the usual merchants
in period-appropriate clothing peddling artisinal handicrafts, plenty of
sausages and beer, bagpipe bands, fire-eaters, tournaments, and so on.  I had
my first experience with mead, which is delicious, and really does taste like
honey.

Keeping with the theme of poetic license, we watched a play that had King
Arthur facing off against Don Pedro to pull the Sword from the Stone, only to
be upstaged by an old woman who needed it to scratch her back.  Guinevere was
ghastly.  It was truly a spectacle.
