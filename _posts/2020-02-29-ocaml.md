Since [moving to a programming language team](/pivot-2020.html), I've
decided I should also learn more about implementation and theory. Last year I
read through [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/)
and [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/), which gave
me more insight for writing a [few](https://github.com/dhconnelly/adso-js)
[small](https://github.com/dhconnelly/yalig)
[interpreters](https://github.com/dhconnelly/lox) and a
[compiler](https://github.com/dhconnelly/crab), but I'd like to go a bit
deeper into advanced techniques and theory. So I picked up [Modern Compiler
Implementation in ML](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/ml/) for the
former and [Types and Programming
Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) for the latter. I
don't know any ML, and while I spent most of January learning Rust (I
[re-implemented](https://github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2019/tree/master/rs)
about a third of Advent of Code and wrote the above [bytecode
compiler](https://github.com/dhconnelly/crab)) and think it's a brilliant and
incredibly well-designed language and ecosystem, it seems like learning an ML
and going even further in the functional direction will be helpful for both
working through these books as well as understanding the functional paradigm.

So far all I've done is skimmed through a very nice [online textbook from
Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/textbook/) and
started working through Advent of Code again while writing a small
interpreter. The language feels both powerful as well as incredibly
concise. For example, here's my implementation of the entire Intcode virtual
machine used throughout the 2019 Advent of Code:

<script
src="https://gist.github.com/dhconnelly/4c107d0190bc8df62cf4a9693944214f.js"></script>

For comparison, my [Rust
version](https://github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2019/blob/master/rs/intcode/src/lib.rs)
is about 3x as long. There are some differences in the implementations, but in
general it's amazing how concise the OCaml implementation is, and how little
difference it made in the performance to use immutable/persistent data
structures and no mutation.

(Full OCaml solutions are
[here](https://github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2019/tree/master/ocaml))

I'm still working on the interpreter, and I'd like to get through several
more Advent of Code problems again before moving on to the compiler book,
but I'm really loving OCaml so far.
