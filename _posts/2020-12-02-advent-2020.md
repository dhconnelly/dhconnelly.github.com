Against my better judgment, I'm doing Advent of Code again this year. Using Rust, about which
I'm very excited. I won't be blogging each solution, unlike last year, so all my code can just
be found on GitHub: [github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2020](https://github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2020).

The fall semester at Hunter is over soon, and I'm finishing up my final paper, so the rest of
the month will be Advent of Code and a lot of Latin. Hoping to do quite a bit of medieval and
church Latin this year, including Archipoeta, some of the Vulgate, and maybe some Bede. And
re-read Orberg's Roma Aeterna. Or: get totally taken over by Advent of Code.
