This year I participated in [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) for the first time; I
[previously wrote](/advent-of-code-2019.html) about why and my
goals. Well, yesterday, on Christmas Day, I finished all fifty
stars!

After finishing part 1 of [Day
25](/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html#day-25), upon
discovering that part 2 was just "have you gotten all the other
stars," I went back and finished part 2 of [Day
22](#/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html#day-22) -- the only
thing I had remaining. After doing that I "activated the warp
drive" and got the fiftieth star!

Except for Day 18 and part 2 of Day 22, I [finished every
problem](img/aoc2019leaderboard.png) on the day it came out and
blogged about it, which was my initial goal. Although sometimes
the blogging took a couple of days :) All the posts are in a
single enormous [blog
post](/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html).


## Topics

Overall I can say that this is my proudest programming-related
acheivement and the most fun I've ever had programming. I had to
relearn a bunch of math and computer science techniques, like 2d
and 3d geometry, modular arithmetic, bit twiddling, basic data
structures and algorithms, BFS/DFS and pathfinding, dynamic
programming, matrix algebra, assembly programming, and cellular
automata. I also learned a bit about computer organization in
practice, something we only briefly touched in university, by
building a virtual machine and
[disassembling](/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html#intcode-reverse-engineering)
an Intcode program to reverse engineer a problem. The breadth and
depth of the topics was truly remarkable. I feel like I used most
of my formal education in one single month. This was so
refreshing after years of iterative large-system building that is
mostly devoid of theoretically-interesting problems. (Not to say
it's not just as important :)


## Problem Solving

I learned a lot about problem solving through countless false
starts, wrong answers, and hours of debugging and refactoring


## Go

Having written [~4800 lines of code in
Go](https://github.com/dhconnelly/advent-of-code-2019), I now
feel as fluent in Go as I do after seven years of
near-uninterrupted C++. The language itself is a refreshing
change of pace: it can fit in one person's head, and the
[spec](https://golang.org/ref/spec) is helpful and clear! I
really felt my problem solving, and not the language, was the
barrier each day -- the code just flowed, and I never sat and
wondered how to express something.

Apart from the first few days, when it seemed like the input
parsing would vary less from day-to-day and so generics might
have been nice, I never seriously missed it. The lack of
expressiveness that comes with e.g. no generics or sum types or
something meant that I just fluently wrote out more explicit code
without thinking hard about it. I understand there's a trade-off
here, and I'm not saying this is necessarily the right side of
it, but it is nice to generally have one way to do something that
is explicit and comprehensible. I'll be interested to see how
they grow the language for Go 2 in a way that keeps it this
small. I really think this is a large part of what makes it
feel refreshing to me after all this C++ and several periods
experimenting with Haskell and Rust, not to mention the
occasional Java and Objective-C I also use at work from time to
time.

Outside of the language, the standard library is easy to use and
comprehensive: the only external dependency I pulled in was
[`tcell`](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell), for [Day
13](/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html#day-13). 

I also developed simple patterns for sets, stacks, queues, trees
and graphs using just slices and maps, which makes it easy to
avoid dependencies entirely for data representation. I wrote that
up a bit in a
[Gist](https://gist.github.com/dhconnelly/7c99902b00874900ef8dff374a04f477).

Channels also made several problems easy, particularly the
Intcode problems, although I need to spend some more time
developing architectural patterns; [Day
23](/advent-of-code-2019-commentary.html#day-23), for example,
needs a bunch of refactoring to make it simpler, more
comprehensible, and eliminate thrashing and contention. But
overall I'm very happy with the way the language approaches
concurrency, which mostly avoids the worst bits of the buggy and
incomprehensible multithreaded code I see all the time at work.

Anyway, all in all I think Go is a great general purpose language
and it was a joy to use it for Advent of Code.
