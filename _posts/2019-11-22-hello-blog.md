Going to write some things. I'd have started weeks ago, but static
site generators are much less easy to work with than advertised (all of them, afaict)
and so I gave up a few times. I built half of a prototype thing to host
on App Engine, decided it would be more hassle in the end than just getting an existing one working, and deleted it. Eventually
got something usable with Jekyll. Anyway, here we are!
