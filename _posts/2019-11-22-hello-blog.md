Going to write some things. I'd have started weeks ago, but static
site generators are bloated, near-unusable shit (all of them, afaict)
and so I gave up a few times. I built half of a prototype thing to host
on App Engine, decided it would be shit too, and deleted it. Eventually
got Jekyll to work. Anyway, here we are!
