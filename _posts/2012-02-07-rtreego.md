I'm taking a graduate databases course this semester that's half survey and half special topics.  Instead of assigning some boring database-backed travel agency application or something, we get to propose a special project exploring some advanced area.  To this end I'm writing an in-memory spatial database in Go.

Since I can't find an existing [R-tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) library for Go, the first step is writing my own.  I've just [started the project on GitHub](https://github.com/dhconnelly/rtreego).  There's not much there right now, just a project skeleton, the README, and the license.  If you're interested in learning more about R-trees, my references are listed on the README and below:

- A. Guttman. [R-trees: A Dynamic Index Structure for Spatial Searching](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/ReadingSeminar/Papers/Guttman84.pdf). Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD, pages 47-57, 1984.
- N. Beckmann, H .P. Kriegel, R. Schneider and B. Seeger. [The R&#42;-tree: An Efficient and Robust Access Method for Points and Rectangles](http://infolab.usc.edu/csci587/Fall2011/papers/p322-beckmann.pdf). Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD, pages 323-331, May 1990.
- N. Roussopoulos, S. Kelley and F. Vincent. [Nearest Neighbor Queries](http://www.postgis.org/support/nearestneighbor.pdf). ACM SIGMOD, pages 71-79, 1995.

These papers are awesome.  The first one, which introduced the R-tree data structure, is one of the best pieces of technical writing I've come across.

An interesting tidbit: Jon Bentley, who wrote [Programming Pearls](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880)--one of the books on my reading list--is cited several times in the Guttman paper.  After some googling, it appears he's written a bazillion highly-cited papers on data structures and algorithms.  That book just moved up on my reading list.
